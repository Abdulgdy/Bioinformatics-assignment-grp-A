# Bioinformatics 
# Introduction to Bioinformatics 
Bioinformatics is the field that combines biology, computer science, and technology to analyze and interpret biological data. It involves the use of computational tools and algorithms to study and understand biological processes, such as genetic sequences, molecular structures, and pathways. By harnessing the power of technology and data analysis, bioinformatics helps researchers answer complex questions about genetics, evolution, diseases, and drug development. It plays a crucial role in modern biological research and is essential for advancements in fields such as genomics, proteomics, and systems biology.
